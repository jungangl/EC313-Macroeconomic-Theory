## Labor Market Equilibrium

Labor Supply or Wage-Setting Relation (WS): 

$$\frac{W}{P} = F\underbrace{(u, z)}_{(-, +)}$$

Labor Demand or Price-Setting Relation (PS): 

$$\frac{W}{P} = \frac{A}{1 + m}$$

## Labor Market Equilibrium

This labor market model is trying to explain .hi[two variables of interest] in our economy:

- Real Wage $\frac{W}{P}$

- Unemployment Rate $u$

# Medium-Run Output

## Derive Output

Recall: the Labor Market Model is a .hi[medium-run] model. 

The .hi[variables of interest] in the labor market model are: __real wage__ and __unemployment rate__. 

__Question: Is output an endogeneou variable?__

We need to know whether output depends on __real wage__ or __unemployment rate__. If output depends on either one of them, the output is endogeneous.

---

# Medium-Run Output

## Derive Output

The answer is that __output is indeed endogeneous__.

Recall:

- Output is $Y = A * \color{#e64173}{N}$ where $N$ is the number of people who are employeed. 

- By definition $u = \frac{L - N}{L}$, where $L$ is the labor force. 

- Transform $u = \frac{L - N}{L}$, we get $\color{#e64173}{N = (1 - u) L}$

- In conclusion, $Y = A * \color{#e64173}{N} = A * \color{#e64173}{(1 - u) L}$

---

# Medium-Run Output

## Derive Output

The answer is that __output is indeed endogeneous__. In conclusion, 
$$Y = A * (1 - u) L$$
__Hence $Y$ depends on $u$ which is one of the variables of interest.__

When $u_n$ is the natural rate of unemployment (equilibrium unemployment rate), we have the following relation for equilibrium output:

$$Y_n = A(1 - u_n)L$$
Here $Y_n$ is called .hi[the natural level of output]. 

---

# Medium-Run Output

## Why "Natural"

.hi[Takeaway]: The natural level of output, Yn, associated with a given natural rate of unemployment, un, is such that the Price Setting and Wage Setting relations are equal!

$Y_n$ and $u_n$ are both .hi[natural] because we assumed .hi.purple[prices equal expected prices]. 

---

# Medium-Run Output

## Conclusion

- __Labor Market Equilibrium__ is determined where $\underbrace{WS}_{Labor Supply} = \underbrace{PS}_{LaborDemand}$

- __The Medium Run Equilibrium__ is determined where WS = PS with the assumption .hi[Price equals Expected Price]! ( $P = P^e$ ).

- __In the medium run__, equilibrium output is entirely determined by the labor market!

- __Q__: What's next?

- __A__: Look at the interaction of Short Run Policy (IS-LM) and the Medium Run (Labor Market)!

---

# Medium-Run Output

## Conclusion

We have now covered two cases:

- (Short-run) IS-LM equilibrium (Ch. 5) - Goods Market and Money Market

- (Medium run) Labor Market Equilibrium (Ch. 6)

---

# Medium-Run Output

## Conclusion

Using these four markets, we can derive (.hi[after the midterm]):

- __Aggregate Supply Relation__: captures the effect of output on the price level. Derived using Labor Market Equilibrium.

  - __Note__: Labor Market determines Aggregate Supply because $Y = A*N$

- __Aggregate Demand Relation__: captures the effect of price level on output. Derived using the IS-LM Equilibrium.

  - __Note__: Goods and Money Market Eqm Determine Aggregate Demand because they capture consumer behavior!
