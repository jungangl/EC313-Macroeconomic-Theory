# Equilibrium Consumption

# Equilibrium Consumption

## Equilibrium Consumption

Consumption is an __endogeneous variable__ in the Goods Market Model, which means the model can be used to explain consumption. 

--

Let's derive the equilibrium consumption equation.

# Equilibrium Consumption

## Equilibrium Consumption

Recall 

`\begin{align}
C &amp; = c_0 + c_1 (\color{#e64173}{Y} - T)
\end{align}`

--

Also in equilibrium

`$$\color{#e64173}{Y} = \frac{1}{1-c_1}(c_0 + \bar I + G + NX) - \frac{c_1}{1 - c_1}T$$`
--

The equilibrium consumption is 

`\begin{align}
C &amp; = c_0 + c_1 \left(\color{#e64173}{\frac{1}{1-c_1}(c_0 + \bar I + G + NX) - \frac{c_1}{1 - c_1}T} - T\right)
\end{align}`

The equilibrium consumption is 

`\begin{align}
C &amp; = \frac{1}{1-c_1}c_0 + \frac{c_1}{1-c_1}(\bar I + G + NX - T)\\
\end{align}`

--

- When `\(c_0\)` goes up by $1, __equilibrium consumption__ goes up by $ `\(\frac{1}{1-c_1}\)`

--

- When either `\(\bar I\)`, or `\(G\)` or `\(NX\)` goes up by $1, __equilibrium consumption__ goes up by `\(\frac{c_1}{1 - c_1}\)`

--

- When T goes up by $1, __equilibrium consumption__ goes down by `\(\frac{c_1}{1 - c_1}\)`

# IS Relation 

## Why?

.hi[Investment Equal Savings] is just another way to describe the goods market. Since our object of interest is still the same, the equilibrium should be the same as well. 


In the end, we should get the same equilibrium equation:
`$$Y = \frac{1}{1 - c_1} (c_0 + \bar I + G + NX) - \frac{c_1}{1 - c_1} T$$`

The only difference is: instead of using .hi[Goods Demand = Goods Supply], we use .hi[Investment = Savings]. 


---

# IS Relation 

## Why?

We already have a way to model the goods market equilibrium. 

- .pink[Demand for Goods = Supply for Goods]

However, our ultimate goal is to describe the whole economy, which also contains the .hi[money market]. 

To establish the connection, we need to find .hi[another perspective] to look at the goods market. 

This alternative perspective is the .hi[Investment-Equal-Saving (IS) relation]

## Savings

Just like when we consider the components of consumption, we first consider the .hi[components of saving]. 

- Consumers: `\(S_C\)`

- Government: `\(S_G\)` 

- Foreigners: `\(S_F\)`

Think about the question, who saves in the economy? The answer is .hi[whoever consumes saves]


---

# Savings

## Savings - Consumers

The consumers has the disposable income `\(Y_D\)` and spends `\(C\)`, their saving would be 
`\(S_C = Y_D - C\)`, recall `\(Y_D = Y - T\)`. Hence we have the following .hi[consumer saving equation]
`$$S_C = Y - T - C$$`
Also, note the consumption is endogenous in the model because C depends on `\(Y\)`, i.e. the __linear consumption funciton__ `\(C = c_0 + c_1(Y - T)\)`, and thus we can further write
`$$S_C = Y - T - (c_0 + c_1 (Y - T))$$`
---
# Savings

## Savings - Government

The government has a tax revenue of `\(T\)` and spends `\(G\)`. Hence we have the following .hi[government saving equation]

`$$S_G = T - G$$`

Note that in macroeconomics government saving is also called __government surplus__

---

# Savings

## Savings - Foreigners

Foreigners also save, and some of their savings end up coming into our economy, and that is the part we are interested in when we study an economy. The part of foreign saving that flows into our economy is called .hi[capital inflow (CI)]

Just like export and import, when there is capital inflow, there is also .hi[capital outflow (CO)], which is domestic saving that goes abroad. 

The true saving from broad that flows into the economy is the difference between inflow and outflow, and thus we have the following condition:
`$$S_F = NCI$$`
Here NCI is the .hi[net capital inflow] and `\(NCI = CI - CO\)`

---

# Savings

## Aggregate Savings

The aggregate saving available in the economy can be computed as follows. 

`\begin{align}
S &amp; = \color{#e64173}{S_C} + \color{#20B2AA}{S_G} + \color{#6A5ACD}{S_F}\\
  &amp; = \color{#e64173}{Y - T - (c_0 + c_1 (Y - T))} + \color{#20B2AA}{T - G} + \color{#6A5ACD}{NCI}\\
  &amp; = Y - (c_0 + c_1 (Y - T)) - G + NCI
\end{align}`

# Investment

# Investment

## Investment

The aggregate investment is straightforward, and you have seen this already.

--

`$$I = \bar I$$`

That is to say; investment is .hi[exogeneous] to the model we are considering. 

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Equilibrium

---

# Equilibrium 

## Solve for the equilibrium

The equilibrium is defined by .hi[equating savings to investment]
`\begin{align}
I &amp; = S \\
\bar I &amp; = Y - (c_0 + c_1 (Y - T)) - G + NCI
\end{align}`
Solving for Y, we get the following equation that characterizes the goods marker equilibrium
`$$Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1}(c_0 + \bar I + G - NCI) - \frac{c_1}{1 - c_1}T$$`
Does this look familiar? It does!

---

# Equilibrium 

## Comparing Two Methods

Using .hi[Goods Demand = Goods Supply], we get (from the last lecture)
`$$Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1}(c_0 + \bar I + G \color{#20B2AA}{+ NX}) - \frac{c_1}{1 - c_1}T$$`
Using .hi[Investment = Savings], we get
`$$Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1}(c_0 + \bar I + G \color{#20B2AA}{- NCI}) - \frac{c_1}{1 - c_1}T$$`
Theoretically, these two equations should be the same. How would we make these two equations identical? 

--
`$$\color{#20B2AA}{NX} = \color{#20B2AA}{-NCI}$$`

---

# Equilibrium 

## Comparing Two Methods

What does this equation mean? 
`$$\color{#20B2AA}{NX} = \color{#20B2AA}{-NCI}$$`
The amount of the .hi[net export] one economy is equal to the amount of .hi[net capital outflow]

__The Lucas paradox__: the observation that capital does not flow from developed countries to developing countries, although developing countries have lower levels of capital per worker.

---

# Equilibrium 

## Paradox of Saving

- "Those who save are promised a happy life." 

- This saying does not apply to our .hi[short-run] model. 

--

What happens if people choose to save more - `\(c_0\)` decrease? 

- What happens to the equilibrium output?

- What happens to equilibrium consumption?

- What happens to equilibrium consumer saving? 

---

# Equilibrium 

## Paradox of Saving - Output

Let's say `\(c_0\)` goes down by one dollar. 

--

Recall the equilibrium output equation from the goods market. 

`$$Y = \frac{1}{1-c_1}(c_0 + \bar I + G + NX) - \frac{c_1}{1 - c_1}T$$`

__Equilibrium Output Y would go down by__ `\(\frac{1}{1 - c_1}\)`

---

# Equilibrium 

## Paradox of Saving - Consumption

Let's say `\(c_0\)` goes down by one dollar. 

--

Recall the equilibrium consumption equation from the goods market. 

`$$C = \frac{1}{1-c_1}c_0 + \frac{c_1}{1-c_1}(\bar I + G + NX - T)$$`

__Equilibrium Consumption C would go down by__ `\(\frac{1}{1 - c_1}\)`

---

# Equilibrium 

## Paradox of Saving - Consumer Saving

Let's say `\(c_0\)` goes down by one dollar.

--

In equilibrium, the households/consumers' saving is 

`\begin{align}
S_C  = &amp; Y_D - C\\
 = &amp; \color{#e64173}{Y} - T - \color{#20B2AA}{C}\\
 = &amp; \color{#e64173}{(\frac{1}{1 - c_1} (c_0 + \bar I + G + NX) - \frac{c_1}{1 - c_1} T)} - T \\ &amp; - \color{#20B2AA}{(\frac{1}{1-c_1}c_0 + \frac{c_1}{1-c_1}(\bar I + G + NX - T))} \\
 = &amp; \bar I + G + NX - T
\end{align}`

---

# Equilibrium 

## Paradox of Saving - Consumer Saving

Let's say `\(c_0\)` goes down by one dollar.

In equilibrium, the households/consumers' saving is 

`\begin{align}
S_C  = \bar I + G + NX - T
\end{align}`

The equilibrium `\(S_C\)` does not depend on `\(c_0\)`!!

--

This means if `\(c_0\)` goes down by one dollar, __consumer saving doesn't change__!!
