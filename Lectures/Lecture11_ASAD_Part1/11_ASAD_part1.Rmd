# Review

## Wage-Setting Relation:

- Workers (Labor Supply) ask wage based on $W = P^e F(u,z)$ 

- We assumed $P^e = P$. This simplifies the WS equations to $W = P F(u,z)$  and __it is this assumption that allows us to solve for__ $u_n$.

- Under this assumption, the equilibrium unemployment rate is called .hi[the natural rate of unemployment].
  
- This assumption allows us to get the .hi.purple[real wage] asked by workers $\frac{W}{P} = F(u, z)$



---

# Review

## Price-Setting Relation:

- We assume that Y = AN, __where A is technology, and N is the number of workers__.

- For __one extra unit of product__, firms need to hire .hi[1/A] more units of labor.

- Therefore, the marginal cost of production is .hi[W/A].

- Firms hold monopoly power: .hi[P = (1 + m) W/A], where __m is the mark-up.__

- We can write the .hi.purple[real wage] offered by firms is .hi.purple[W/P = (1 + m)/A]

---

# Review

## Labor Market Equilibrium

__Set the real wage asked workers equal to offered by firms__:


$$F(u, z) = \frac{A}{1 + m}$$

# Review

## Labor Market Equilibrium

__Set the real wage asked workers equal to offered by firms__:


$$F(u_n, z) = \frac{A}{1 + m}$$
$u_n$ is the natural rate of unemployment

According to the equilibrium equation, we can study how $u_n$ responds to changes in $z, A, m$

- $z$ increases $u_n$ increases

- $A$ increases $u_n$ decreases

- $m$ increases $u_n$ increases

## Medium Run

- Now we want to study the behavior of the economy in the __medium run__. 

- A hallmark of the medium run is that .hi[prices change]!

- We need to have a model to incorporate __price__ as a variable of interest.

- The other variable of interest is __output__ (GDP). 

- We need to build a model for .hi[Aggregate Supply] that models the behaviors of __price and output__.

# Overview

## Short Run v.s Medium Run

Short-run story For aggregate supply:

- .hi[Demand goes up]

- .hi[Firms produce more to meet the demand]...

- __...without changing__

  - i) the number of people they hire
  
  - ii) prices of their products
  
  - iii) wages they offer to their employees.

# Overview

## Short Run v.s Medium Run

Medium run story For aggregate supply:

- .hi[Demand goes up]

- .hi[Firms produce more to meet the demand] __by hiring more workers__. 

- __Conseuqences__: 

  - i) Nominal wage goes up
  
  - ii) More costly to produce, so the price goes up.
  
  - iii) Higher price makes workers ask for a higher nominal wage.
  
  - __goes back to i) ...__

## What's Next

We have now covered two cases:

- (Short-run) IS-LM equilibrium (Ch. 5) - Goods Market and Money Market

- (Medium run) Labor Market Equilibrium (Ch. 6)

# Overview
  
## What's Next

(Short-run) IS-LM equilibrium (Ch. 5) - Goods Market and Money Market

- Gives us .hi[Aggregate Demand Relation]: captures __the effect of price level on output__. 

- Note that IS-LM captures __consumer behaviors__, that's why it's called .hi[AD] (aggregate demand) relation. 

---
# Overview
  
## What's Next

(Medium run) Labor Market Equilibrium (Ch. 6)

- Gives us .hi[Aggregate Supply Relation]: captures __the effect of output level on price__. 

- Note that Labor Market captures __firms behaviors__, that's why it's called .hi[AS] (aggregate supply) relation.

# Aggregate Supply Relation

## Labor Market Equilibrium Revisited

__The AS Relation represents (medium run) equilibrium in the Labor Market.__

Recall labor supply (WS) and labor demand (PS): 

\begin{align}
\text{WS} & : W = P^eF(u,z)\\
\text{PS} & : P = (1 + m) W / A
\end{align}

Before we assumed $P = P^e$ to solve for a specific equilibrium, $u_n$. __We now drop this assumption!__

Why?

--

Because we want to .hi[model the behavior of price] $P$, which is one of the variables of interest in the AS-AD model. 

---

# Aggregate Supply Relation

## Labor Market Equilibrium Revisited

__The AS Relation represents (medium run) equilibrium in the Labor Market.__

From now on, let's make a simplifying assumption: __technology A = 1__. This assumption is good for .hi[the medium run]. 

Recall labor supply (WS) and labor demand (PS): 

\begin{align}
\text{WS} & : \color{#e64173}{W} = P^eF(u,z)\\
\text{PS} & : P = (1 + m) \color{#e64173}{W} 
\end{align}

Combining the above two equations, we get the __labor market equilibrium equation__:

$$P = (1 + m) P^eF(u,z)$$

---

# Aggregate Supply Relation

## Labor Market Equilibrium Revisited

We get the __labor market equilibrium equation__:

$$P = (1 + m) P^eF(u,z)$$
__Q__: We want an equation for .hi[P] and .hi[Y] . How do we get there?

__A__: Note .hi.purple[u] is related to .hi[Y]. Sub in for u! 

- By definition $u = \frac{L-N}{L} = 1 - \frac{\color{#e64173}{N}}{L}$. 

- Also $\color{#e64173}{Y = N}$

- Hence $u = 1 - \frac{Y}{L}$

# Aggregate Supply Relation

## AS Relation

We get the __labor market equilibrium equation__ in terms of .hi[P] and .hi[Y]. This is the AS Relation:

\begin{align}
P = (1 + m) P^eF(1 - \frac{Y}{L},z) 
\end{align}

P = (1 + m) P^eF(1 - \frac{Y}{L},z) 
\end{align}

__Q: If Y increases, what happens to P? __

__A: P increases.__

--

Mathematically

- .hi[Y increases]

- $1 - \frac{Y}{L}$ goes down

- $F(1 - \frac{Y}{L}, z)$ goes up

- .hi[P goes up]

# Aggregate Supply Relation

\begin{align}
P = (1 + m) P^eF(1 - \frac{Y}{L},z) 
\end{align}

__Q: If Y increases, what happens to P? __

__A: P increases.__

--

Intuitively

- .hi[Y increases]

- Unemployment rate decreases

- Workers ask for a higher wage

- More expensive for firms to produce goods

- .hi[Firms increase price P].
