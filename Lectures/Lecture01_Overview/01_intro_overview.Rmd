# Macroeconomics - GDP

## GDP

- Economics is a social science that studies __people__

- At the end of the day, __People__ want to be happy

- Measuring the __performance of an economy__ boils down to how happy the people are. 

- __GDP__ (Gross Domestic Production) is a  commonly used measure for happiness (standard of living). 

- If a country produces more goods in value during a period (higher GDP), __in general__, the people in that country have more resources to be __happier__. 

---

# Macroeconomics - GDP

## GDP

- In the 19th century, economists had __no measure of aggregate activity__. They had to put bits and pieces of information such as the shipments of iron ore or sales at some department stores to __infer__ what was happening to the economy. 

- Measures of aggregate output have been published on a __regular basis__ in the United States since October 1947.

- The measure of aggregate output in the national income accounts is called the gross domestic product, or __GDP__, for short.

# Macroeconomics - GDP

## GDP Calculation 

There are .hi[two ways] to calculate GDP

- Production Side

- Income Side

Theoretically, these two sides should give you the .hi[same results]. 

---

# Macroeconomics - GDP

## GDP - Production Side

- GDP Is the .hi[Sum of Value Added] in the Economy .hi[during] a Given Period. 

  - Suppose there are firms index by $j$, and there are $J$ of them in the economy. Firm $j$ produces good $j$.
  
  - The quantity of good $\mathop{j}$ is $\mathop{q_j}$ during this period. 
  
  - Choose a year, say 2010, and get the market value (price) of good $j$ is $p_j$ for that year.
  
  - The GDP measured in 2010 dollar is $Y = q_1 p_1 + q_2 p_2 + \dots + q_J p_J$

# Macroeconomics - GDP

## GDP - Income Side

- GDP Is the .hi[Sum of Incomes] in the Economy .hi[during] a Given Period.

  - Suppose there are people index by $i$ and there are $I$ of them in the economy
  
  - Person $i$ works $h_i$ hours during this period
  
  - Person $i$'s wage (dollar per hour) is $w_i$ during this period. 
  
  - The GDP is $Y = h_1 w_1 + h_2 w_2 + \dots + h_N w_N$

# Inflation

## Inflation Computation (Pt.1)

- .hi[Inflation] measures the .hi[price change in percentage]. When we compute the inflation, we need three things: 
  1. Base Year: $\tau$ 
  2. Start Year: $T_0$
  3. End Year:  $T_1$
  
  - Formula: $\Pi_{T_1, T_0}^{\tau} = \frac{CPI^{\tau}_{T_1}}{CPI^{\tau}_{T_0}} - 1$

---

# Inflation

## Inflation Computation (Pt.2)

- __Price (CPI)__ measures the __value of the basket of goods__ relative to the __base year__. When we compute the CPI, we need two things:
  1. Value of Basket of Goods Evaluated at the __Base Year Price__: $V_\tau$ 
  2. Value of Basket of Goods Evaluated at the __Year of Interest's Price__: $V_T$
  - Formula: $CPI^{\tau}_{T} = V_{T} / V_{\tau}$

---

# Inflation

## Inflation Computation (Pt.3)

- __The basket of goods__ is a fixed set of consumer products and services. 

- This basket contains what an __average consumer__ consumes for that year. 

- The basket is __updated__, and CPI will need revisions as long as there are significant changes in consumer buying habits or shifts in population distribution or demographics.

- [Check out the full list through this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C2nJ12sdxMae7tsC76ba6Hfe9DgXTxckcUCVGr6Eygs/edit)

# Inflation

Suppose in an __imaginary country__, the basket of goods only contains __pizza, beer, coffee__, and the base year is $2010$. The consumption quantities and prices are given by 

```{r echo = F, cache = T}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
dt <- data.frame("Firms" = c("Pizza", "Beer", "Coffee"),
                 "Quantity" = c(50, 100, 150),
                 "Price2010" = c(8, 4, 1), 
                 "Price2015" = c(8, 3, 2),
                 "Price2018" = c(10, 5, 2))

# Macroeconomics - Deficit

## Government Deficit

- The U.S. federal budget deficit for the fiscal year 2020 is __$1.103 trillion__

- The __deficit__ occurs because the U.S. __government spending__ of $4.746 trillion is higher than its __tax revenue__ of 
__$3.422 trillion__.

- The deficit is __18 percent greater__ than last year.

---

# Macroeconomics - Deficit

## Government Deficit

- Deficit = __Government Spending__ - __Tax Revenue__

- Why do we need __Government Spending__ 

  - __Boost Economy__ (That's why political parties overspend on purpose)

  - Provide __Public Goods__ 
  
      - Flood Control in the Netherlands v.s. Hurricane Katrina
      
      - Education
      
      - Defense

# Macroeconomics - Deficit

## Government Deficit

- Why do we need __Tax__

  - To Finance __Government Spending__
  
  - To Provide __Incentives (Externalities)__
   
- Why don't we like __Tax__

  - American __Traditional Value__ (Small Government)
  
  - __Market Distortion__ (Can be partially avoided)
