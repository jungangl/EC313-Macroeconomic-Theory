## Natural Output

Recall the __natural output level__ is the equilibrium output implied by the AS curve when `\(P^e = P\)`

`\begin{align}
\text{AS Relation:} P &amp; = P^e (1 + m)F(1 - \frac{Y}{L},z)
\end{align}`

## Natural Output

Recall the __natural output level__ is the equilibrium output implied by the AS curve when `\(P^e = P\)`

`\begin{align}
\text{AS Relation:} 1 &amp; = (1 + m)F(1 - \frac{Y_n}{L},z)
\end{align}`

Assumptions: Given `\(m, L, z\)`, the natural rate of output is fixed. 

Question: Given `\(m = 0, L = 1, z = 0.5\)` and `\(F = z/(1 - \frac{Y_n}{L})\)` what is the natural rate of output `\(Y_n\)`?

## AS Relation and AD Relation

`\begin{align}
\text{AS Relation:} P &amp; = P^e (1 + m)F(1 - \frac{Y}{L},z)\\
\text{AD Relation:} Y &amp; = Y(\frac{M}{P}, G, T)
\end{align}`
Given `\(P^e, m, L, z\)`, and `\(M, G, T\)` these two relations will determine equilibrium output, Y, and prices, P.

## AS Relation and AD Relation

&lt;center&gt;
 &lt;img src="FIGURES/ASAD.PNG" width="400" height="300"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

- At point A, we are in .hi[a Short Run Equilibrium] implied by AS=AD (__As every point on AD is an SR equilibrium__).

- `\(P_A\)` and `\(Y_A\)` corresponding to point A represent __the equilibrium values of the Price Level and Output__.

## AS Relation and AD Relation

&lt;center&gt;
 &lt;img src="FIGURES/ASAD.PNG" width="400" height="300"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

- Point A represents equilibrium in the .hi[goods market, the money market] (__because it is a point on the AD curve, and AD comes from the IS-LM Model__) as well as .hi[equilibrium in the Labor Market] (__because it is a point on the AS curve, and AS comes from the Labor Market__)

# SR Transitions to MR

Consider the following AS-AD model.

&lt;center&gt;
 &lt;img src="FIGURES/ASAD.PNG" width="400" height="300"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

__Note__: `\(Y &gt; Y_n\)` at point A. 

- Here `\(Y\)` is found from AS=AD. 

- `\(Y_n\)` is found given `\(m, L, z\)`

---

# SR Transitions to MR

Consider the following AS-AD model.

&lt;center&gt;
 &lt;img src="FIGURES/ASAD.PNG" width="400" height="300"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

__Question:__ When `\(Y &gt; Y_n\)` at point A, is `\(P\)` higher than `\(P^e\)`? 

__Answer:__  Yes!

---

# SR Transitions to MR

Consider the following AS-AD model.

&lt;center&gt;
 &lt;img src="FIGURES/ASAD.PNG" width="400" height="300"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

__Question:__ In the short run, is it ok for `\(P\)` to be higher than `\(P^e\)`? 

__Answer:__  Yes! In the short run, prices do not change. `\(P\)` doesn't have to be the same as `\(P^e\)`

---

# SR Transitions to MR

__Q__: What happens when .hi[Pe &lt; P] as we move to the __Medium Run__?

- If .hi[Pe &lt; P], then actual prices are above expected prices. What will
this do to expectations?

--

- .hi[Pe] increases! People ask for a higher nominal wage (__WS equation__).

--

- In the labor market equilibrium, nominal wage __W increases__. 

--

- Higher W causes P to increase because firms will increase prices when wages increase (__PS equation__)

--

Another way of saying all of this: __Pe increases, so the AS curve shifts up__! 


---

# SR Transitions to MR

Q: If we increase Pe, the AS shifts up, and we still aren’t in equilibrium at Yn, what do we do?

- We increase our expectations AGAIN!

--

- We increase .hi[Pe] until expectations match equilibrium prices .hi[P]! 

--

- At this point, there is no incentive to change expectations. 

--

- `\(P_e = P\)` and `\(Y = Y_n\)`, our __short run equilibrium__ has transition to __the medium run equilibrium__!

---

# SR Transitions to MR

If we __increase `\(P_e\)`__, __the AS shifts up__, and we __still aren’t in equilibrium at `\(Y_n\)`__

- What do we do?

- `\(Y' &gt; Y_n\)`

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

# SR Transitions to MR

## Takeaways:

- Whenever equilibrium output is higher than the natural rate of output, equilibrium prices are higher than expected prices. 

--

- Whenever equilibrium prices are higher than expected prices, expected prices increase!

--

- In the __medium run__, __equilibrium output is always equal to the natural rate of output__!

---
# SR Transitions to MR

## Takeaways:

- __Medium Run Equilibrium output__ in the AS-AD model is entirely determined by __the labor market__! 

  - Recall that `\(Y_n\)` depends on only `\(m, L, z\)`
  
--

- __Monetary and Fiscal policy only have short-run effects on output__ in the AS-AD model (see examples in the next few slides)!

# Policy Evaluation

## Policy Neutrality

The distinction between .hi[Neutral] and .hi[non-Neutral] .hi.purple[Policies] is very important when discussing the medium-run effects of Monetary and Fiscal Policy.

A policy change (changing M, G, or T) is said to be neutral if:

- .hi[The policy doesn't change the real variables] 

- So far, we have seen four real variables: Y (output), i (interest rate), W/P (real wage), M/P (real money supply)

---

# Policy Evaluation

## Method 1

When we change __policy variables (M, G, or T)__ in our AS-AD model...

Method 1: Ignore the IS-LM Model, and analyze both the short run and medium run effects of a policy change __using only the AS-AD graph__.

- __Advantage__: __Quicker and simpler__ method for understanding the impact of a policy change on P and Y in the Short Run and Medium Run.

- __Disadvantage__: We do not know what happens to the interest rate.

---

# Policy Evaluation

## Method 2

When we change __policy variables (M, G, or T)__ in our AS-AD model...

Method 2: __Graph the IS-LM Model above__ our AS-AD market and analyze policy changes in both markets.

- __Advantage__: We now have a way of understanding the impact of our policy in the Short Run and Medium run on the __interest rate, prices, and output__.

- __Disadvantage__: We have to be more careful in the way that we graph our policy shocks and equilibrium adjustments.

 &lt;img src="FIGURES/ASADeq.PNG" width="400" height="120"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

__Q__: Starting at the Medium Run equilibrium point, if the Fed decides to purchase bonds, what happens to M?

__A__: M increases!

__Q__: If M increases, what happens to the AS relation and the AD relation?

__A__: M is not in the AS relation, so the AS curve stays the same. M enters into the AD relation positively, so for the same value of P, Y is now higher! The AD curve shifts right!

---

# Monetary Expansion

## Method 1

Suppose we are at some point A where AS=AD. At point A, `\(Y_A = Y_n\)` so `\(P_A = P^e\)`.  __What are the SR and MR equilibrium effects of the Fed buying bonds?__

__Short Run Equilibrium__:

- When M increases, the AD curve shifts right (for the same P, Y is higher).

- AD and AS intersect at a new point, A', corresponding to higher output ( `\(Y_{A'} &gt; Y_A = Y_n\)` ) and prices ( `\(P_{A'} &gt; P_A = P^e\)` ).

---

# Monetary Expansion

## Method 1

Suppose we are at some point A where AS=AD. At point A, `\(Y_A = Y_n\)` so `\(P_A = P^e\)`.  __What are the SR and MR equilibrium effects of the Fed buying bonds?__

__Medium Run Equilibrium__:

- Equilibrium prices are higher than expected prices.

- Expected prices, `\(P^e\)` increase. This shifts the AS curve up.

- This continues until AS intersects AD at the MR equilibrium point A''.

- At A'' , Prices ( `\(P_{A''}\)` ) are higher than they were at A or A' and __output has returned to its natural rate__.

&lt;/center&gt;


---

# Monetary Expansion

## Method 2: Short Run

__IS-LM__:

- M increases. Nothing happens in the goods market. IS curve does not shift.

- M increase leads to `\(M^s\)` shifting right. Thus i is lower, but Y has not changed.

- LM curve shifts down. New equilibrium at `\(B\)` with `\(Y_{B} &gt; Y_A\)`

---

# Monetary Expansion

## Method 2: Short Run

AS-AD

- `\(Y_B &gt; Y_A\)`, but prices hanven't changed. Thus AD .hi[shifts right] to AD'.

- AD' intersects AS at a new point B. `\(Y_{A'} &gt; Y_A\)` and `\(P_{A'} &gt; P_A\)`. 

Back to IS-LM

- Price has increased. Thus the .hi[real money supply] has decreased, and LM shifts up until IS=LM at point A'. 

---

# Monetary Expansion

## Method 2: Medium Run

Back to IS-LM

- Equilibrium prices are higher than expected prices.

- Expected prices, `\(P^e\)` increase. This shifts the AS curve up.

- This continues until AS intersects AD at the MR equilibrium point A''.

- At A'' , Prices ( `\(P_{A''}\)` ) are higher than they were at A or A' and __output has returned to its natural rate__.

- __Price increases, real money supply increases, the interest rate goes up and hence LM shifts up.__

# Monetary Expansion

## More Questions

When the monetary expansion occurs:

__Q__: What is the __SR equilibrium effect__ on output, prices, and the interest rate?

__A__: In the SR, __output, and prices are higher__, and the __interest rate is lower__ than before the monetary expansion.

---

# Monetary Expansion

## More Questions

When the monetary expansion occurs:

__Q__: What is the __MR equilibrium effect__ on output, prices, and the interest rate?

__A__: __Output: In the MR__, output returns to it’s original value, `\(Y_n\)` . (See IS relation)

__A__: __Interest Rate: In the MR__, the output returns to `\(Y_n\)`. Thus the IS and LM intersect at their original point, and the interest rate is unchanged.

__A__: __Prices: In the MR__, Prices P increase.

---

# Monetary Expansion

## Neutrality of Money

__In the SR__, a money supply increase leads to higher output. 


__In the MR__, the output is unaffected by a money supply increase, and the entire effect of an increase in M is absorbed by the rise in the price level, P. So real money supply (M/P) is unchanged. 


---

# Monetary Expansion

## Neutrality of Money

__The Neutrality of Money__: 

.hi[In the medium run], 

- money has no real effect. It does not impact Y or i 

- It has a nominal effect (P increases).


__Q__: Does this mean the fed should not perform monetary policy?

__A__: NO!

*“In the long run, we are all dead!” John Maynard Keynes.*

---

# Monetary Expansion

## Neutrality of Money

Sometimes __short run gains are justifiable__ even if they have no long-run effects!

.hi[Also]: 

- We analyzed a policy change when we __started in with a natural rate of output__. 

- If we start .hi[below the natural rate of output], then the expansionary policy could speed up our return to the __MR__!

- If we start .hi[above the natural rate of output], then the contractionary policy could speed up our return to the __MR__!

# Fiscal Contraction

# Fiscal Contraction

## Method 1

Suppose AS=AD at some point `\(A\)`. At `\(A\)`, `\(Y_A = Y_n\)` thus `\(P_A = P^e\)`. What are the SR and MR effects of .hi[a decrease in government spending from G] to __G′ &lt; G__?


__Short Run Equilibrium__:

- When G decreases, the AD curve shifts left (for the same P, Y is higher).

- AD and AS intersect at a new point, A', corresponding to lower output ( `\(Y_{A'} &lt; Y_A = Y_n\)` ) and prices ( `\(P_{A'} &lt; P_A = P^e\)` ).


---

# Fiscal Contraction

## Method 1

Suppose AS=AD at some point `\(A\)`. At `\(A\)`, `\(Y_A = Y_n\)` thus `\(P_A = P^e\)`. What are the SR and MR effects of .hi[a decrease in government spending from G] to __G′ &lt; G__?

__Medium Run Equilibrium__:

- Equilibrium prices are lower than expected prices.

- Expected prices, `\(P^e\)` decreases. This shifts the AS curve down.

- This continues until AS intersects AD at the MR equilibrium point A''.

- At A'' , Prices ( `\(P_{A''}\)` ) are lower than they were at A or A' and __output has returned to its natural rate__.

# Fiscal Contraction

## More Questions

When fiscal contraction occurs:

__Q__: What is the __SR equilibrium effect__ on output, prices, and the interest rate?

__A__: In the SR, output, prices, and the interest rate are all lower than before the decrease in G.

---

# Monetary Expansion

## More Questions

When the monetary expansion occurs:

__Q__: What is the __MR equilibrium effect__ on output, prices, and the interest rate?

__A__: __Output: In the MR__, the output returns to its original vale, Yn.

__A__: __Interest Rate__: Looking at the IS-LM relation, we can see that the interest rate has decreased in the medium run. This must happen to balance the IS relation!!!

__A__: __Prices: In the MR__, Prices P decrease
