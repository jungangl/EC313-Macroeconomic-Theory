## Natural Output

Recall the __natural output level__ is the equilibrium output implied by the AS curve when $P^e = P$

\begin{align}
\text{AS Relation:} P & = P^e (1 + m)F(1 - \frac{Y}{L},z)
\end{align}

---

## Natural Output

Recall the __natural output level__ is the equilibrium output implied by the AS curve when $P^e = P$

\begin{align}
\text{AS Relation:} 1 & = (1 + m)F(1 - \frac{Y_n}{L},z)
\end{align}

Assumptions: Given $m, L, z$, the natural rate of output is fixed. 

Question: Given $m = 0, L = 1, z = 0.5$ and $F = z/(1 - \frac{Y_n}{L})$ what is the natural rate of output $Y_n$?

## AS Relation and AD Relation

\begin{align}
\text{AS Relation:} P & = P^e (1 + m)F(1 - \frac{Y}{L},z)\\
\text{AD Relation:} Y & = Y(\frac{M}{P}, G, T)
\end{align}
Given $P^e, m, L, z$, and $M, G, T$ these two relations will determine equilibrium output, Y, and prices, P.

- At point A, we are in .hi[a Short Run Equilibrium] implied by AS=AD (__As every point on AD is an SR equilibrium__).

- $P_A$ and $Y_A$ corresponding to point A represent __the equilibrium values of the Price Level and Output__.

- Point A represents equilibrium in the .hi[goods market, the money market] (__because it is a point on the AD curve, and AD comes from the IS-LM Model__) as well as .hi[equilibrium in the Labor Market] (__because it is a point on the AS curve, and AS comes from the Labor Market__)

# SR Transitions to MR

Consider the following AS-AD model.

<center>
 <img src="FIGURES/ASAD.PNG" width="400" height="300">
</center>

__Note__: $Y > Y_n$ at point A. 

- Here $Y$ is found from AS=AD. 

- $Y_n$ is found given $m, L, z$

# SR Transitions to MR

Consider the following AS-AD model.

<center>
 <img src="FIGURES/ASAD.PNG" width="400" height="300">

__Question:__ When $Y > Y_n$ at point A, is $P$ higher than $P^e$? 

__Answer:__  Yes!

---

# SR Transitions to MR

Consider the following AS-AD model.

<center>
 <img src="FIGURES/ASAD.PNG" width="400" height="300">
</center>

__Question:__ In the short run, is it ok for $P$ to be higher than $P^e$? 

__Answer:__  Yes! In the short run, prices do not change. $P$ doesn't have to be the same as $P^e$

---

# SR Transitions to MR

__Q__: What happens when .hi[Pe < P] as we move to the __Medium Run__?

- If .hi[Pe < P], then actual prices are above expected prices. What will
this do to expectations?

--

- .hi[Pe] increases! People ask for a higher nominal wage (__WS equation__).

--

- In the labor market equilibrium, nominal wage __W increases__. 

--

- Higher W causes P to increase because firms will increase prices when wages increase (__PS equation__)

--

Another way of saying all of this: __Pe increases, so the AS curve shifts up__! 


---

# SR Transitions to MR

Q: If we increase Pe, the AS shifts up, and we still aren’t in equilibrium at Yn, what do we do?

- We increase our expectations AGAIN!

--

- We increase .hi[Pe] until expectations match equilibrium prices .hi[P]! 

--

- At this point, there is no incentive to change expectations. 

--

- $P_e = P$ and $Y = Y_n$, our __short run equilibrium__ has transition to __the medium run equilibrium__!

---

# SR Transitions to MR

If we __increase $P_e$__, __the AS shifts up__, and we __still aren’t in equilibrium at $Y_n$__

- What do we do?

- $Y' > Y_n$

# SR Transitions to MR

## Takeaways:

- Whenever equilibrium output is higher than the natural rate of output, equilibrium prices are higher than expected prices. 

--

- Whenever equilibrium prices are higher than expected prices, expected prices increase!

--

- In the __medium run__, __equilibrium output is always equal to the natural rate of output__!

---
# SR Transitions to MR

## Takeaways:

- __Medium Run Equilibrium output__ in the AS-AD model is entirely determined by __the labor market__! 

  - Recall that $Y_n$ depends on only $m, L, z$
  
--

- __Monetary and Fiscal policy only have short-run effects on output__ in the AS-AD model (see examples in the next few slides)!

# Policy Evaluation

## Policy Neutrality

The distinction between .hi[Neutral] and .hi[non-Neutral] .hi.purple[Policies] is very important when discussing the medium-run effects of Monetary and Fiscal Policy.

A policy change (changing M, G, or T) is said to be neutral if:

- .hi[The policy doesn't change the real variables] 

- So far, we have seen four real variables: Y (output), i (interest rate), W/P (real wage), M/P (real money supply)

---

# Policy Evaluation

## Method 1

When we change __policy variables (M, G, or T)__ in our AS-AD model...

Method 1: Ignore the IS-LM Model, and analyze both the short run and medium run effects of a policy change __using only the AS-AD graph__.

- __Advantage__: __Quicker and simpler__ method for understanding the impact of a policy change on P and Y in the Short Run and Medium Run.

- __Disadvantage__: We do not know what happens to the interest rate.

---

# Policy Evaluation

## Method 2

When we change __policy variables (M, G, or T)__ in our AS-AD model...

Method 2: __Graph the IS-LM Model above__ our AS-AD market and analyze policy changes in both markets.

- __Advantage__: We now have a way of understanding the impact of our policy in the Short Run and Medium run on the __interest rate, prices, and output__.

- __Disadvantage__: We have to be more careful in the way that we graph our policy shocks and equilibrium adjustments.

 <img src="FIGURES/ASADeq.PNG" width="400" height="120">
</center>

__Q__: Starting at the Medium Run equilibrium point, if the Fed decides to purchase bonds, what happens to M?

__A__: M increases!

__Q__: If M increases, what happens to the AS relation and the AD relation?

__A__: M is not in the AS relation, so the AS curve stays the same. M enters into the AD relation positively, so for the same value of P, Y is now higher! The AD curve shifts right!

---

# Monetary Expansion

## Method 1

Suppose we are at some point A where AS=AD. At point A, $Y_A = Y_n$ so $P_A = P^e$.  __What are the SR and MR equilibrium effects of the Fed buying bonds?__

__Short Run Equilibrium__:

- When M increases, the AD curve shifts right (for the same P, Y is higher).

- AD and AS intersect at a new point, A', corresponding to higher output ( $Y_{A'} > Y_A = Y_n$ ) and prices ( $P_{A'} > P_A = P^e$ ).

---

# Monetary Expansion

## Method 1

Suppose we are at some point A where AS=AD. At point A, $Y_A = Y_n$ so $P_A = P^e$.  __What are the SR and MR equilibrium effects of the Fed buying bonds?__

__Medium Run Equilibrium__:

- Equilibrium prices are higher than expected prices.

- Expected prices, $P^e$ increase. This shifts the AS curve up.

- This continues until AS intersects AD at the MR equilibrium point A''.

- At A'' , Prices ( $P_{A''}$ ) are higher than they were at A or A' and __output has returned to its natural rate__.

# Monetary Expansion

## Method 2: Short Run

__IS-LM__:

- M increases. Nothing happens in the goods market. IS curve does not shift.

- M increase leads to $M^s$ shifting right. Thus i is lower, but Y has not changed.

- LM curve shifts down. New equilibrium at $B$ with $Y_{B} > Y_A$

---

# Monetary Expansion

## Method 2: Short Run

AS-AD

- $Y_B > Y_A$, but prices hanven't changed. Thus AD .hi[shifts right] to AD'.

- AD' intersects AS at a new point B. $Y_{A'} > Y_A$ and $P_{A'} > P_A$. 

Back to IS-LM

- Price has increased. Thus the .hi[real money supply] has decreased, and LM shifts up until IS=LM at point A'. 

---

# Monetary Expansion

## Method 2: Medium Run

Back to IS-LM

- Equilibrium prices are higher than expected prices.

- Expected prices, $P^e$ increase. This shifts the AS curve up.

- This continues until AS intersects AD at the MR equilibrium point A''.

- At A'' , Prices ( $P_{A''}$ ) are higher than they were at A or A' and __output has returned to its natural rate__.

- __Price increases, real money supply increases, the interest rate goes up and hence LM shifts up.__

# Monetary Expansion

## More Questions

When the monetary expansion occurs:

__Q__: What is the __SR equilibrium effect__ on output, prices, and the interest rate?

__A__: In the SR, __output, and prices are higher__, and the __interest rate is lower__ than before the monetary expansion.

---

# Monetary Expansion

## More Questions

When the monetary expansion occurs:

__Q__: What is the __MR equilibrium effect__ on output, prices, and the interest rate?

__A__: __Output: In the MR__, output returns to it’s original value, $Y_n$ . (See IS relation)

__A__: __Interest Rate: In the MR__, the output returns to $Y_n$. Thus the IS and LM intersect at their original point, and the interest rate is unchanged.

__A__: __Prices: In the MR__, Prices P increase.

---

# Monetary Expansion

## Neutrality of Money

__In the SR__, a money supply increase leads to higher output. 


__In the MR__, the output is unaffected by a money supply increase, and the entire effect of an increase in M is absorbed by the rise in the price level, P. So real money supply (M/P) is unchanged. 


---

# Monetary Expansion

## Neutrality of Money

__The Neutrality of Money__: 

.hi[In the medium run], 

- money has no real effect. It does not impact Y or i 

- It has a nominal effect (P increases).


__Q__: Does this mean the fed should not perform monetary policy?

__A__: NO!

*“In the long run, we are all dead!” John Maynard Keynes.*

---

# Monetary Expansion

## Neutrality of Money

Sometimes __short run gains are justifiable__ even if they have no long-run effects!

.hi[Also]: 

- We analyzed a policy change when we __started in with a natural rate of output__. 

- If we start .hi[below the natural rate of output], then the expansionary policy could speed up our return to the __MR__!

- If we start .hi[above the natural rate of output], then the contractionary policy could speed up our return to the __MR__!

# Fiscal Contraction

## Method 1

Suppose AS=AD at some point $A$. At $A$, $Y_A = Y_n$ thus $P_A = P^e$. What are the SR and MR effects of .hi[a decrease in government spending from G] to __G′ < G__?


__Short Run Equilibrium__:

- When G decreases, the AD curve shifts left (for the same P, Y is higher).

- AD and AS intersect at a new point, A', corresponding to lower output ( $Y_{A'} < Y_A = Y_n$ ) and prices ( $P_{A'} < P_A = P^e$ ).


---

# Fiscal Contraction

## Method 1

Suppose AS=AD at some point $A$. At $A$, $Y_A = Y_n$ thus $P_A = P^e$. What are the SR and MR effects of .hi[a decrease in government spending from G] to __G′ < G__?

__Medium Run Equilibrium__:

- Equilibrium prices are lower than expected prices.

- Expected prices, $P^e$ decreases. This shifts the AS curve down.

- This continues until AS intersects AD at the MR equilibrium point A''.

- At A'' , Prices ( $P_{A''}$ ) are lower than they were at A or A' and __output has returned to its natural rate__.

---

# Monetary Expansion

## More Questions

When the monetary expansion occurs:

__Q__: What is the __MR equilibrium effect__ on output, prices, and the interest rate?

__A__: __Output: In the MR__, the output returns to its original vale, Yn.

__A__: __Interest Rate__: Looking at the IS-LM relation, we can see that the interest rate has decreased in the medium run. This must happen to balance the IS relation!!!

__A__: __Prices: In the MR__, Prices P decrease
